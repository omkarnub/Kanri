## [1.1.0] - 2026-11-04

### Added
- Dedicated **Themes & Appearance window** (`ThemeSettingsScreen`) with visual preview cards for System, Light, Dark, AMOLED, and Glass.
- **Side-by-side (2-column) live WebGL shader background cards** in Glass mode (Aurora, Grain Gradient, Hero Geometric, Prism Gradient, Cloud Shader, Ink Ridges, Fuji Sakura, Sumi-e Mist).
- **User Birthday setting** in Profile (`ProfileScreen`) using `KanriGlassDatePickerDialog`.
- **Dynamic Birthday Greeting** on the Home screen wishing the user on their special day.
- **Birthday Celebration Notifications** via `BirthdayHelper` scheduled on the user's birthday.
- Redesigned **Permissions & Detection** with interactive toggle switches for SMS Detection, Notification Listener, Notifications, Overlay, and Battery Exemption.
- Streamlined **Customise Glass Components** screen with 4 essential sliders: Frosted blur, Glass tint, Border & edge shine, and Corner curvature, with dedicated "Reset to default" and "Save & Exit" buttons.

### Changed
- Strictly decoupled Glass engine and live WebGL backgrounds from standard themes: live backgrounds and glass customizers are now completely excluded from composition in Light, Dark, and AMOLED modes.
- Added lifecycle hooks to `GlassBackgroundView` to explicitly stop and destroy WebGL WebViews when exiting Glass mode, eliminating background CPU/GPU/battery drain.
- Normalized contrast ratios and colors across all themes (Light cream `#FBF8EE`, Dark charcoal `#121212`, AMOLED pitch black `#000000`, and Glass frosted tint) adhering to WCAG AA guidelines.
- Bumped application version to `1.1.0` (Build 4).

### Removed
- Removed Google Drive Cloud Backup to preserve a 100% offline-first architecture with local encrypted/plain JSON backups.
- Removed Test Lock Screen action from Security & Privacy.
- Removed Dynamic Colors toggle and Reduce Transparency toggle.
- Removed all presets and live simulated preview widget from the Glass Customizer.
- Removed obsolete `ThemesCustomizationScreen.kt`.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-09-27
